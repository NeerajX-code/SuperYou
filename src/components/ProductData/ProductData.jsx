        ingredientInfo: `Protein: 10g per 40g wafer. A unique blend of fermented nutritional yeast protein and milk solids with a PDCAAS 1.0/1.0. 

Coconut Oil: 7g per 40g wafer (or just 1.61 teaspoon!). Many chocolates rely on palm oil, but not us. We use hydrogenated coconut oil instead - a healthier, more thoughtful choice for you and the planet.

Maltitol: We use Maltitol (INS 965), a nature-identical, bio-engineered sweetener made from cornstarch. It delivers the sweetness you love without the sugar spike as it has a low GI of just 35 (compared to sugar's 85-90). We use 10g per 40g of chocolate wafer, which is well within the RDA guidelines of 30-40g for healthy adults. You'll see “no added sugar” on our packaging as per FSSAI guidelines.

Maida: Here's the deal: each SuperYou wafer contains only 2g of maida, the equivalent of a single bite of biscuit or one-fourth slice of bread. While maida is not nutritionally better than atta, it isn't harmful if consumed in moderate amounts.

Flavors: If it's not delicious, it's just not SuperYou. Expect nothing less than incredible flavors in every bite. Peanut Butter (2g) + Natural Cocoa Powder (6g) + Cocoa Butter (3g) + Flavor Chocolate & Peanut (0.005g). Total 11.005g. All natural flavors and flavoring substances that we use are approved by FSSAI. 

Others: Some other ingredients we use as preservatives and stabilisers are Lecithin Soy (1g), Ethyl Vanillin (0.0001g), PGPR (0.001g), and Improver Enzyme (0.001g). That's all! Just 2.0021g out of a total of 40g of your SuperYou Protein Wafer.`
